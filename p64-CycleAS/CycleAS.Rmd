##### CycleAS, 22nd November 2017
### Analysis of some of this AS statistics dataset, including data wrangling and plots
```{r}


# To open excel data;
library(readxl)
cycleData <- read_excel("~/Documents/purpleR/p64-CycleAS/9781471852978_Data_set (1).xlsx")
```
To convert gender from character to factor use
```{r}
cd <- cycleData
cd$gender <- as.factor(cd$gender)
```
To see relative frequencies of males and females use
```{r}
summary(cd$gender)
```
  and we see that most accidents involve males.
  
To see a histgram of ages use
```{r}
hist(cd$age, breaks=10)
```
and we see that most are under 20yrs old.
