Problem:
  I want to find the seonc heaviest chicken who was fed horsebean.
     weight      feed
     179 horsebean
     160 horsebean
. 71 obs, 6 factors

Solution:

```{r}
cw<-tbl_df(chickwts)
cw %>%
  filter(feed=='horsebean') %>%
  summarise(second=nth(weight,2,order_by=weight)
```
We can this of this as, find nth value of weight where n=2. Use 'second' as the name of the column in the result.
Result is second; 124 (1 x 1) local data frame
