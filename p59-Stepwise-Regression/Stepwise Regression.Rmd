```{r}
cement <- read.table("~/MyR/Regression/cement.txt", header=T, quote="\"")
lm_null<-lm(y~1,data=cement)
lm_full<-lm(y~x1+x2+x3+x4,data=cement)
step_result <- step(lm_null, scope=list(lower=lm_null, upper=lm_full), direction="forward")
```
We can see that minimum AIC is acheived for y ~ x4 + x1 + x2
