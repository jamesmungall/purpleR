```{r}
require(crossdes)
# format is find.BIB(treatments(t), blocks(b), blocksize(k) )
my.design = find.BIB(4, 4, 3)
# To check if balanced;
isGYD(my.design)
# The output is written in numbers. I have previously used letters for treatments.
treat_letters <- LETTERS[my.design]
for(i in 1:length(my.design)){
  my.design[i] <- treat_letters[i]
}

# Note that blocks are rows. When I have written BIBD I have used a column for each block.
# To change this, transpose matrix output.
print(t(my.design))
